#Counter-Firebase-Timestamps

So this is just an App that has a timer set to 40sec, and once it finishes, it adds a timestamp in the database of the firebase. Another screen will retrieve all the entries and list them in order.

#### ToDos

- Subscription to the data for new entries
- backend background process runs the timer and triggers the new entry in the database
- Input to change the timer seconds
